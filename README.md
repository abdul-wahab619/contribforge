# ContribForge

ContribForge is an open-source platform designed to make discovering, tracking, and managing open-source contributions easier for developers.

Instead of jumping between GitHub tabs, issues, and notes, ContribForge helps you **find the right issues, save them, and track your contribution journey in one place**.

---

## Why ContribForge?

Open source is powerful, but the entry barrier is high.

Common problems developers face:

* Finding beginner-friendly issues
* Losing track of saved repositories and issues
* No clear view of contribution progress
* Hard to showcase open-source work publicly

ContribForge aims to solve this.
